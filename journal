In our next lesson, we looked at the OSI model, or the Open Systems Interconnection model, which serves as a basis of structure for computing or networking systems.
The OSI model can be thought of as indicating the level of abstraction in a system.
There are 7 levels in the OSI model; Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation and Application
Each of these levels have their unique constituent parts of a system.
After looking at this, we also created python programs by establishing a secure connection with raspberry pis through ssh, and creating and running python programs on the raspberry pis.
