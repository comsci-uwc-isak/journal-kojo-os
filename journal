today, we begun by looking into the classifications of networks; based on size and topology.
then we proceeded to use terminal to access other devices (raspberry pis) that were on the same network as our own devices through the ip addresses.
this took about 30-40 mins
we also briefly discussed the topology of the network in ISAK
then we proceeded to dsicuss our progress on our IAs
