We begun our sixth lesson with a quick quiz, which was followed by a brief talk about what symmetrical encryption.
Symmetrical encryption is a form of encrytion where the key used to encode and decode is the same.
On the other hand, asymmetrical encryption makes use of a public key and a private key to encode and decode

Next, we proceeded to create the backbone (basic HTML page setup and CSS) of a webpage that will enable a user to encrypt text with any given key.
In this lesson, I saw some more aspects of HTML, such as the functions of classes and id's, which i found very interesting
