In our fourth lesson, my class was split into two sections based on prior knowledge of web design and programming, with each group having to work on a unique task.
I had very little experience with HTML and CSS, and so, I was placed in the group whose task was focused around learning basic HTML.
We started by installing an app called Webstorm, which is a powerful IDE for creating webpages.
Then, we installed certain packages (Pug, Stylus, Coffee, i think i forgot the actual names) which allowed us to create webpages by using a simpler format.
For example, we no longer had to use opening ang closing tags to code. These packages were basically simplified versions of HTML and CSS.
With these packages, we created simple webpages and were able to view the effects of each of our changes in real-time.
