We begun our seventh lesson with a brief session where we lookd at certain key IB question words, and we practiced on how to answer these questions properly based on the words used.
After that, we worked on our uncompleted encryption applications.
This lesson was mainly focused on finishing the Javascript aspect of the application.
It was quite simple, but quite interesting.

Note to self: Improve CSS and HTML skills by learning more commands, etc.
